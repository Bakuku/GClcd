LCD add-on for the Gamecube based off of GCdual (GCvideo)

Idea behind this project is to provide Gamecube players with an add-on LCD replacing the old one released back in begin 2000. Use excisting GCvideo tech to improve image quality of the Gamecube while also allowing user to play over HDMI on modern TV.

Add-on screen uses RGBHV (VGA) Analog input to display image. Support for both 480i and 480p. During 480i display you may experience some slight flickering (Gamecube boot screen BIOS is always displayed in 480i).

Passthrough over mini-HDMI allowing simultaneous output on both TV and Add-on.
